**3D Animations**
1. Plan your animations: Before you begin animating, take the time to plan out your animations. This includes deciding on the key poses, timing, and overall look of the animation.

2. Start with a strong foundation: A good animation starts with a solid foundation, such as proper rigging and weighting of the character or object. This will ensure that the animation is smooth and believable.

3. Use keyframe interpolation wisely: Blender offers several different types of keyframe interpolation, such as linear and bezier. Use these wisely to create smooth and believable animations.

4. Animate with the final game in mind: Keep the final game in mind while animating. This includes considering the game's art style, frame rate, and how the animation will be used in the game.

5. Keep it simple: Simple animations are often more effective than complex ones. Try to focus on the most important aspects of the animation and leave out unnecessary details.

 6. Use Blender's built-in tools: Blender offers a wide range of built-in tools for animating, such as the dopesheet, the graph editor, and the action editor. Take the time to learn these tools and use them to your advantage.

7. Test your animations: Test your animations in the game engine to ensure that they look and function as intended.

8. Use Blender's non-linear animation (NLA) editor: The non-linear animation editor allows you to create and edit multiple animations at once, this is useful to keep your animation library organized.

9. Keep it consistent: Keep your animations consistent with the rest of the game, this means not only in terms of the style but also in terms of timing and motion.
